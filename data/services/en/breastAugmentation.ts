      '<strong>Breast augmentation</strong> involves the use of silicone breast implants or your own fat to enhance the size of your breasts. This procedure can enhance under-developed breasts as well as restore breast volume following weight loss or pregnancy. At Roop Plastic Surgery Clinique, our expert surgeons combine advanced surgical techniques with personalized care for safe, natural-looking, and long-lasting results.',
      '<strong>Am I a good candidate?</strong> You may be a good candidate for breast augmentation if: your breasts are naturally small and poorly developed and you want larger breasts; weight loss has changed the shape and size of your breasts; your breasts have become smaller and lost firmness after pregnancy; one of your breasts is noticeably smaller than the other. Breast augmentation cannot completely correct severely droopy breasts - in such cases, you may require a combination of breast augmentation and breast lift surgery.',
      '<strong>About Breast Implants:</strong> All breast implants are made of an outer silicone shell. <strong>Types by filling:</strong> Saline (silicon shell filled with saline) and Silicone (filled with highly cohesive medical grade silicone gel - extremely resistant to rupture with no leakage). <strong>Types by shape:</strong> Round (most commonly used) and Anatomical/tear-shaped (mimics natural breast contour). <strong>Types by surface:</strong> Smooth, Textured (roughened and grainy - "Micro" or "Nano"-textured), and Poly-urethane coated.',
      '<strong>Choosing the correct implant size:</strong> Breast implants are available from 100cc to 1000cc. Selection depends on your desired size (e.g., B cup to C cup requires 175-200cc), what your body can accommodate based on chest width, existing breast tissue volume, skin laxity, and nipple position. Your qualified Aesthetic surgeon will discuss your concerns and priorities to arrive at the ideal breast implant size for you.',

    description:
      '<strong>1. BREAST IMPLANT PROCEDURE:</strong> Performed under general anaesthesia. Incisions are made in inconspicuous areas - most surgeons prefer the <strong>infra-mammary incision</strong> (under the breast) for optimal access and barely noticeable scars. Other options include periareolar (around areola) and transaxillary (armpit). A pocket is created either <strong>submuscular</strong> (under pectoral muscle), <strong>subglandular</strong> (over pectoral muscle), or <strong>sub-fascial</strong> (modified plane). The implant is inserted, positioned with nipple-areola centralized, and closed with self-dissolving sutures. Surgery takes about 2 hours - may be day care or overnight stay. <strong>2. FAT TRANSFER:</strong> Involves harvesting fat via liposuction from abdomen, back, or thighs; processing the fat to separate unwanted components; and transferring purified fat in small droplets into subcutaneous and sub-glandular planes. <strong>Advantages:</strong> Better customization, no allergic reactions or rejection, no capsular contracture risk, and easy touch-up procedures.',
    features: [
      '<strong>Pre-Operative Requirements:</strong> Choose a qualified Aesthetic plastic surgeon routinely performing breast augmentation. STOP 2 weeks before surgery: blood thinners (ecosprin, clopidogrel, warfarin), estrogen hormones, Vitamin E, ginseng, green tea, ginkgo biloba, garlic pearls, ayurvedic supplements. Stop smoking minimum 1 week prior. Routine pre-operative investigations and mammogram required to rule out any existing lumps or lesions.',
      '<strong>Recovery - Implant:</strong> Sore for a day or two, up and about after 24 hours. Skin tightness for a few weeks. Avoid exercises & strenuous activities for 4-6 weeks. No sleeping on sides for 3 weeks, no prone sleeping for 6 weeks. Dressing changes on day 4/5 and 8/9. Self-massage after 3 weeks. Final shape visible at 2-3 months; scars settle in 3-6 months. <strong>Recovery - Fat Transfer:</strong> Significant swelling settles in 7-14 days. Bruising fades by 7 days. Return to work in 5-7 days. Secondary sittings may be required due to unpredictable fat survival rates.',
      '<strong>Important:</strong> Breast augmentation DOES NOT cause breast cancer, affect fertility, pregnancy, or breastfeeding. Follow-up semi-annually with ultrasound yearly and mammogram every 2 years. Report any fresh pain or hardening immediately.',

        title: 'Breast Lift (Mastopexy)',
        description: [
          '<strong>What is Breast Lift?</strong> Normal youthful breasts are firm with a rounded contour, the nipple being at the center of the breast mound. Breasts may lose firmness and droop due to ageing, deflation after breastfeeding, or significant weight loss. <strong>Breast lift surgery</strong> is designed to lift and tighten breasts that have lost volume and are sagging, restoring a more youthful appearance.',
          '<strong>Am I a good candidate?</strong> You may be a good candidate if: you are bothered by sagging or loss of shape and volume; your breasts have a flatter, elongated, or pendulous shape; when unsupported, nipples point downward or fall below the under-breast fold; you have stretched skin and enlarged areolas; one breast is lower than the other. <strong>Breast Ptosis Grades:</strong> Normal (nipple above fold with good volume), Grade I (nipple at fold level), Grade II (nipple below fold but above lower pole volume), Grade III (nipple below fold and at/below lower pole volume), Pseudo-ptosis (nipple above fold but tissue droops below).',

        title: 'Breast Lift Surgery Options & Recovery',
        description: [
          '<strong>Surgery Options by Ptosis Grade:</strong> Normal breasts with loss of upper pole fullness - breast augmentation alone. Grade I Ptosis - augmentation alone or breast lift, some may need peri-areolar pexy (Crescent or Donut). Grade II & III Ptosis - formal breast lift surgery required; some patients wanting larger size may be offered <strong>Augmentation Mastopexy</strong> (simultaneous implant + lift). Severe sagging after significant weight loss requires more extensive procedures due to loss of tissue elasticity.',
          '<strong>Incision Types for Mastopexy:</strong> Periareolar (around areola only), Vertical/Lollipop (areola + vertical line down), Inverted T/Anchor (areola + vertical + horizontal in fold). <strong>Recovery:</strong> Overnight hospital stay. NOT associated with much pain - mild painkillers for a few days. Walk same evening. Wear well-fitting elastic bra for 4-6 weeks. Dressings every 4-5 days for 2 weeks. Resume non-strenuous activities in 5-7 days, routine work in 7-14 days, exercises after 4 weeks. Scars firm and pink for 6 weeks, settle in 3-6 months. Final shape at 2-3 months.',

        title: 'Breast Reduction',
        description: [
          '<strong>What is Breast Reduction?</strong> Significantly enlarged breasts can cause distress. Women with very large breasts suffer from neck/back pain, sleep disturbances, skin rashes, limited clothing options, hindrance to physical activities, unwanted attention, and emotional stress. <strong>Breast reduction surgery</strong> permanently solves these issues and restores aesthetic shape and size.',
          '<strong>Am I a good candidate?</strong> You may be a good candidate if you have: breasts too large for your body frame; heavy sagging breasts with very low nipples; restriction of physical activity due to size/weight; back, neck, shoulder pain and chafing; skin irritation and rashes beneath breasts; psychological distress due to large size; one breast much larger than the other.',

          '<strong>Surgery Options:</strong> 1) <strong>Liposuction</strong> - sucks out excess fatty tissue resulting in size reduction. Does not reduce glandular tissue. When skin elasticity is poor, may result in exaggerated sagging. 2) <strong>Surgical Breast Reduction</strong> - a) Inverted T scar (older technique, more extensive scars, useful for extremely large breasts with severe sagging) b) <strong>Vertical/Lollipop scar</strong> (gold standard today - less extensive scars, better and more durable breast contours).',
          '<strong>Recovery:</strong> Hospital stay 24-48 hours. Drain tubes removed in 24-48 hours. NOT associated with significant pain - breast sensations may be reduced initially and gradually return. Moderately potent painkillers sufficient. Walk same evening. Wear elastic bra for 4-6 weeks. Dressings every 4-5 days for 2 weeks. Resume non-strenuous activities in 5-7 days, routine work in 10-14 days, exercises after 4 weeks. Scars firm and pink for 6 weeks, settle in 3-6 months.

    {
      question: 'What size breast implants should I choose?',
      answer:
        'Implant size selection depends on your chest width, existing breast tissue, skin quality, body frame, and aesthetic goals. Your surgeon will help you choose using measurements, sizers, and 3D imaging. The goal is natural-looking results that complement your body proportions, not just choosing the largest possible size.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Will I be able to breastfeed after breast augmentation?',
      answer:
        'Most women can breastfeed successfully after augmentation, especially with submuscular placement and inframammary or transaxillary incisions. Periareolar incisions have slightly higher risk of affecting milk ducts. Discuss breastfeeding goals with your surgeon during consultation.',
    },
    {
      question: 'What are the possible complications of breast implant surgery?',
      answer:
        'Possible complications include: scar-related issues, seroma/hematoma, infection (rare), skin necrosis (in smokers, diabetics, or with very large implants), persistent pain, implant malposition, implant rupture (rare with cohesive gel), atrophy of breast tissue, palpable ripples, altered nipple sensation, ptosis over time, asymmetry, capsular contracture, and BIA-ALCL (very rare lymphoma - NOT breast cancer, easily treatable if detected early). Report any fresh swelling, hardening, rash, or mass immediately.',
    },
    {
      question: 'What are the risks specific to fat transfer breast augmentation?',
      answer:
        'Fat transfer risks include: under-correction due to excessive fat absorption requiring second session; fat necrosis, cyst formation, or calcification from large boluses of fat. Small cysts may settle; persistent ones may require aspiration or removal. Fat transfer does not cause breast cancer, but cysts/calcification may mimic cancer on mammography - experienced radiologists can differentiate these changes.',
    },
    {
      question: 'What can go wrong with breast lift or reduction surgery?',
      answer:
        'Possible complications include: early swelling, bruising, discomfort (expected); seroma or hematoma (usually settle, rarely need aspiration); wound breakdowns (higher risk in smokers, diabetics, very large breasts); reduced nipple sensation (recovers over 6 months to 1 year); asymmetry (minor differences normal, major asymmetry rare); scar issues like dog-ears, darkening, thickening, or stretching (treated with creams/gels or minor procedures).',
    },
    {
      question: 'How long do breast implants last?',
      answer:
        'Breast implants are not lifetime devices but can last 10-20+ years. Some women never need replacement, while others may require it due to rupture, capsular contracture, or desire for size change. Regular monitoring with ultrasound yearly and mammogram every 2 years is important for long-term safety.',
    },
    {
      question: 'When can I return to work and exercise after breast surgery?',
      answer:
        'For augmentation: desk work within 1 week, exercise after 4-6 weeks. For lift: non-strenuous activities in 5-7 days, routine work in 7-14 days, exercises after 4 weeks. For reduction: non-strenuous activities in 5-7 days, routine work in 10-14 days, exercises after 4 weeks. Avoid heavy lifting for 6 weeks for all procedures.',
