      'At Roop Plastic Surgery Clinique, we offer comprehensive <strong>cosmetic gynecology</strong> procedures addressing both functional and aesthetic concerns of the intimate area. These procedures help women regain confidence, improve intimate comfort, enhance sexual satisfaction, and address concerns related to childbirth, aging, or congenital anatomy. We provide a private, confidential, and compassionate environment where women can discuss sensitive concerns with experienced specialists. Our approach combines advanced surgical techniques and non-surgical technologies to deliver safe, effective, and natural-looking results.',
      '<strong>Non-Surgical Treatments</strong> include <strong>Laser Vaginal Tightening (Vaginal Rejuvenation)</strong> which uses fractional CO2 laser technology to stimulate collagen production in vaginal tissues, improving vaginal tightness, elasticity, and lubrication. This non-invasive procedure treats vaginal laxity after childbirth, improves stress urinary incontinence, enhances sexual satisfaction, and requires no downtime. Treatment involves 2-3 sessions spaced 4-6 weeks apart, each lasting 15-20 minutes. Results are noticeable after the first session and continue to improve over 3-6 months. <strong>Vaginal Botox (Vaginismus Treatment)</strong> involves injecting botulinum toxin into vaginal muscles to treat vaginismus (involuntary muscle spasms causing painful intercourse), helping relax overactive pelvic floor muscles and allowing comfortable penetration.',
      '<strong>Surgical Procedures</strong> provide permanent solutions for anatomical concerns. <strong>Vaginoplasty (Vaginal Tightening Surgery)</strong> surgically tightens the vaginal canal and surrounding muscles, typically after childbirth or aging has caused significant laxity. The procedure removes excess vaginal lining and tightens muscles, performed under general or spinal anesthesia, takes 1-2 hours, with 4-6 weeks recovery and results that are permanent. <strong>Labiaplasty (Labial Reduction)</strong> reduces and reshapes enlarged or asymmetrical labia minora (inner lips) or labia majora (outer lips), addressing discomfort during exercise, intercourse, or wearing tight clothing, improving aesthetic appearance and symmetry. Performed under local anesthesia with sedation or general anesthesia, recovery takes 2-4 weeks with minimal scarring.',

      '<strong>Hymenoplasty (Hymen Reconstruction)</strong> is a surgical procedure to reconstruct the hymen, typically requested for cultural, religious, or personal reasons. The procedure takes 30-45 minutes under local anesthesia, involves suturing torn hymen edges or creating a new membrane using vaginal tissue, requires 4-6 weeks healing, and results appear natural. This is a confidential procedure performed with utmost discretion and privacy. <strong>Vaginal Fat Grafting (G-Spot Augmentation)</strong> involves harvesting fat from another body area (typically abdomen or thighs) through liposuction, purifying it, and injecting into the anterior vaginal wall to enhance the G-spot area. This may increase sensitivity and sexual pleasure, with results lasting 1-2 years as some fat is reabsorbed over time.',
    features: [
      '<strong>Clitoral Hood Reduction</strong> removes excess tissue covering the clitoris to enhance sensitivity and improve aesthetic appearance. This is often combined with labiaplasty for comprehensive intimate rejuvenation. <strong>Monsplasty (Mons Pubis Reduction)</strong> reduces excess fat and skin from the mons pubis (pubic mound) through liposuction and/or surgical excision, creating a flatter, more contoured appearance and improving comfort in tight clothing. This procedure is particularly popular after significant weight loss.',
      '<strong>Perineoplasty (Perineal Reconstruction)</strong> repairs and tightens the perineum (area between vagina and anus) that may have been stretched or torn during childbirth. This improves structural support, enhances sexual sensation, and creates a more youthful appearance. Often combined with vaginoplasty for comprehensive vaginal rejuvenation. <strong>Combination Procedures:</strong> Many patients opt for combination treatments such as vaginoplasty with labiaplasty, laser vaginal tightening with labiaplasty, or perineoplasty with vaginoplasty for comprehensive intimate rejuvenation addressing multiple concerns simultaneously.',

        title: 'Candidacy & Pre-Procedure Preparation',
        description: [
          'Ideal candidates for cosmetic gynecology procedures include women experiencing vaginal laxity or dryness after childbirth or menopause, those with enlarged or asymmetrical labia causing discomfort or self-consciousness, women with stress urinary incontinence (mild to moderate), those seeking to improve sexual satisfaction and intimate confidence, women wanting hymen reconstruction for personal, cultural, or religious reasons, and those bothered by excess tissue in the intimate area. Candidates should be in good general health, have realistic expectations, and have completed childbearing for best long-term results.',
          'Pre-procedure preparation varies by treatment. For surgical procedures: comprehensive gynecological examination, lab work including STD screening, pap smear if due, pregnancy test, avoiding sexual intercourse for 1-2 weeks before surgery, maintaining good intimate hygiene, and arranging for someone to drive you home. For laser treatments: no special preparation needed, treatment can be performed during office visit, avoid intercourse for 2-3 days before treatment. All procedures require candid discussion of medical history, current medications, and any previous intimate surgeries or trauma.',

        title: 'Recovery, Results & Long-Term Care',
        description: [
          'Recovery varies by procedure. <strong>Laser vaginal tightening:</strong> No downtime, mild warmth or slight discharge for 1-2 days, avoid intercourse for 3-5 days after each session, resume normal activities immediately. <strong>Surgical procedures:</strong> Avoid intercourse for 6-8 weeks, no tampons or douching for 6 weeks, avoid strenuous exercise for 4-6 weeks, expect mild swelling, bruising, and discomfort (managed with medication), wear loose, cotton underwear, maintain excellent hygiene, attend follow-up appointments for suture removal and healing assessment.',
          'Results: Laser treatments show gradual improvement over 3-6 months with maintenance sessions recommended every 12-18 months. Surgical procedures provide permanent results, though future pregnancies or significant weight changes may affect outcomes. Most women report improved comfort, enhanced confidence, better sexual satisfaction, and relief from functional concerns. Scarring from surgical procedures is minimal and hidden within natural skin folds. Long-term care includes maintaining healthy weight, practicing pelvic floor exercises (Kegels), good intimate hygiene, and regular gynecological check-ups. All procedures and consultations are handled with utmost confidentiality and discretion.',

      question: 'Are these procedures safe and confidential?',
      answer:
        'Yes, all cosmetic gynecology procedures are safe when performed by qualified specialists. We maintain complete confidentiality - all consultations and treatments are conducted in private settings, and your information is protected by strict medical privacy laws. No information is shared without your explicit consent.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Will these procedures affect my ability to have children?',
      answer:
        'Most cosmetic gynecology procedures do not affect fertility or ability to conceive. However, future pregnancies and vaginal delivery may reverse results of vaginal tightening procedures. It\'s recommended to complete childbearing before undergoing vaginoplasty for best long-term results. Discuss your family planning goals during consultation.',
    },
    {
      question: 'How long before I can resume sexual activity?',
      answer:
        'For laser treatments: 3-5 days. For surgical procedures like labiaplasty, vaginoplasty, or hymenoplasty: 6-8 weeks. This healing period is crucial for proper recovery and optimal results. Your surgeon will guide you based on your individual healing progress.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Will there be visible scarring?',
      answer:
        'Surgical procedures involve incisions, but scars are strategically placed within natural skin folds and are typically minimal and well-hidden. With proper healing and care, scars fade significantly over 6-12 months and are usually not noticeable. Laser treatments involve no incisions and therefore no scarring.',
    },
    {
      question: 'How long do results last?',
      answer:
        'Surgical procedures like vaginoplasty, labiaplasty, and hymenoplasty provide permanent results (unless affected by future childbirth). Laser vaginal tightening results last 12-18 months and can be maintained with periodic touch-up sessions. Fat grafting results last 1-2 years as some fat is naturally reabsorbed.',
