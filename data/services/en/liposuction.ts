      'At Roop Plastic Surgery Clinique, we offer comprehensive <strong>liposuction/lipoplasty</strong> procedures to remove unwanted fat deposits permanently. Liposuction slims and reshapes specific areas of the body by permanently removing localized or regional fat deposits, thereby improving and achieving the desired body contours and proportions. This ultimately results in enhancing self-image and confidence. Both obese as well as people in the normal weight range are candidates for liposuction.',
      '<strong>Targeted Fat Removal</strong> works best for those with average weight by removing localized fat deposits that are stubborn, recurrent or do not respond to diet and exercise. For an obese person, it primarily reshapes multiple areas, resulting in permanent fat and weight loss. Some of the most desired areas for fat removal are <strong>double chin, arms, chest, abdomen, back, buttocks, thighs and calves</strong>. The body produces fat cells during three different periods: in utero, early childhood and early adolescence.',
      '<strong>Permanent Results:</strong> In general, after reaching puberty, the total number of fat cells in the body does not increase (exception being morbid obesity). Fat cells that are removed through liposuction are not replaced by other fat cells, so the resultant loss of fat and weight is usually permanent. During the procedure, the area from where the fat is to be removed is marked and infiltrated with saline based solutions (tumescent fluid) through a small (less than 1 cm) and inconspicuous incision.',

      '<strong>Multiple Technique Options:</strong> The fat is liquefied and sucked out of the body with the help of a powerful suction device. The fat may be liquefied with the help of <strong>Ultrasonic, Laser and Vibra assisted devices</strong> or with conventional liposuction cannulas. The liposuction procedure may be carried out under local, regional or general anesthesia, based on the area to be treated and the preference of plastic surgeon or the patient. <strong>Large Volume Liposuction (Mega-Liposuction):</strong> The extra fat present in different parts of the body can usually be removed in a single session. For a person who is obese, large volume liposuction can comfortably remove more than 5 litres of liquefied fat and even up to 15 to 20 litres of fat in one session.',
    features: [
      '<strong>Multi-Area Treatment:</strong> When fat needs to be removed from multiple areas of the body e.g. front and back, it may require more than one session. As blood loss during the liposuction procedure is minimal, blood transfusions are not required. Liposuction as a procedure needs to be carried out at a fully equipped surgical facility. A patient undergoing small volume liposuction may be discharged in less than 24 hours.',
      '<strong>Skin Tightening & Additional Procedures:</strong> The skin laxity partly reduces after liposuction and is usually taken care of with continual use of a pressure garment. However for an area with excessively loosened skin or in some older patients with poor skin elasticity, a procedure of <strong>Skin-Plasty e.g. Abdominoplasty/Tummy Tuck/Body Lift/Breast Ptosis correction or Thigh & Arm-plasty</strong> is preferred to achieve nice contour. This may be combined with liposuction during primary surgery or carried out on a later date.',
      '<strong>Recovery & Results:</strong> A person who has undergone small volume liposuction can resume normal activities within a couple of days while a person who has undergone large volume liposuction may resume normal activities within 7-10 days. Patients are mobilised within 4-6 hours of the surgery. After liposuction, patients will appreciate immediate deflation of the operated area. The actual visible results become apparent after a period of 3 weeks to 3 months and will continue to improve over a year.',

        description: [
          'Every liposuction procedure begins with comprehensive consultation and body assessment. The area from where fat is to be removed is marked and infiltrated with tumescent fluid through small incisions (less than 1 cm). The procedure is performed under appropriate anesthesia based on the treatment area and patient preference. A large volume liposuction patient will preferably be required to stay for 24 hours post-surgery, while small volume patients may be discharged in less than 24 hours.',
          'During the initial healing period, patients may commonly experience some swelling, numbness, soreness or discomfort which can easily be controlled with medication. Tiny incisions may be left open to allow excess fluid to seep out during immediate post-operative periods. With time these seal off on their own. Pressure garments are worn either immediately post-surgery or after 2-3 days (large volume liposuction patients). It is preferable to wear pressure garments continuously for 2-3 months to prevent oedema and help achieve smooth contouring and skin tightening.',

          'Post the liposuction procedure, it is advisable to follow the plastic surgeon\'s instructions and attend follow up visits as scheduled. Patients are mobilised within 4-6 hours of surgery. A person who has undergone small volume liposuction can resume normal activities within a couple of days, while those who underwent large volume liposuction may resume normal activities within 7-10 days.',
          'After liposuction, patients will appreciate immediate deflation of the operated area. However, the swelling that ensues will delay the actual visible results. This will become apparent after a period of 3 weeks to 3 months and will continue to improve over a year. In order to enjoy the effects and benefits of your liposuction procedure, it is important to maintain your weight and practice a healthy lifestyle which includes eating right and regular physical activity. The results are permanent as removed fat cells are not replaced.',
