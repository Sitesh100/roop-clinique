      '<strong>PRP (Platelet-Rich Plasma) Therapy:</strong> PRP is a regenerative treatment that uses your own blood platelets to stimulate healing and rejuvenation. At Roop Clinique, we offer PRP for <strong>hair restoration</strong> (stimulates dormant hair follicles, promotes hair growth, reduces hair thinning), <strong>facial rejuvenation</strong> (vampire facial - improves skin texture, reduces fine lines, enhances collagen production), and <strong>scar treatment</strong> (reduces acne scars, stretch marks, and surgical scars). The procedure involves drawing a small amount of blood, processing it to concentrate platelets, and injecting the PRP into target areas. Results develop over 3-6 months with 3-4 sessions recommended.',
      '<strong>Chemical Peels:</strong> Chemical peels are medical-grade skin resurfacing treatments that remove damaged outer layers to reveal smoother, brighter skin underneath. Roop Clinique offers <strong>superficial peels</strong> (glycolic, lactic acid - for mild discoloration, rough texture, acne), <strong>medium peels</strong> (TCA - for deeper wrinkles, uneven skin tone, moderate sun damage), and <strong>deep peels</strong> (phenol - for severe wrinkles, pronounced sun damage, precancerous growths). Benefits include improved skin texture, reduced fine lines, diminished acne scars, even skin tone, and treatment of hyperpigmentation. Recovery varies from 1-2 days for light peels to 2-3 weeks for deep peels.',
      '<strong>Medical Cosmetology:</strong> Roop Clinique provides comprehensive medical cosmetology services including <strong>Botulinum Toxin Therapy</strong> (reduces dynamic wrinkles like forehead lines, crow\'s feet, frown lines - results last 3-6 months), <strong>Dermal Fillers</strong> (hyaluronic acid fillers for lip enhancement, cheek augmentation, nasolabial fold correction, under-eye hollows - results last 6-18 months), <strong>Mesotherapy</strong> (micro-injections of vitamins, enzymes, hormones for skin rejuvenation and fat dissolution), and <strong>Thread Lifts</strong> (PDO threads for non-surgical face lifting and skin tightening). All procedures are performed by qualified professionals using FDA-approved products.',
      '<strong>Wart Removal:</strong> Warts are benign skin growths caused by HPV (Human Papillomavirus). At Roop Clinique, we offer multiple wart removal methods: <strong>Electrocautery</strong> (burning warts with electric current - effective for common and plantar warts), <strong>Cryotherapy</strong> (freezing with liquid nitrogen), <strong>Laser removal</strong> (precise destruction with minimal scarring), and <strong>Chemical cauterization</strong> (for smaller warts). Treatment is quick (15-30 minutes), and most warts are removed in 1-3 sessions. We treat all types including common warts, plantar warts (foot), flat warts, and genital warts (with appropriate referral).',

      '<strong>Laser Tattoo Removal:</strong> Roop Clinique offers advanced Q-switched Nd:YAG laser tattoo removal, the gold standard for safe and effective tattoo removal. The laser breaks down tattoo ink particles into smaller fragments that your body naturally eliminates over time. <strong>How it works:</strong> High-intensity light pulses target the tattoo pigment without damaging surrounding skin. Different wavelengths target different ink colors - 1064nm for black/dark colors, 532nm for red/orange colors. <strong>Sessions required:</strong> Most tattoos require 6-12 sessions spaced 6-8 weeks apart. Factors affecting treatment include tattoo size, ink colors, ink depth, tattoo age, and skin type. Amateur tattoos typically require fewer sessions than professional ones. <strong>Recovery:</strong> Mild redness, swelling, and blistering may occur for 1-2 weeks. Avoid sun exposure during treatment course. Results are gradual with progressive fading after each session.',

      '<strong>Mole & Skin Tag Removal:</strong> Safe removal of benign skin growths including moles, skin tags, seborrheic keratosis, and DPNs (Dermatosis Papulosa Nigra). Methods include radiofrequency ablation, electrocautery, and laser removal. Procedure takes 15-30 minutes with minimal downtime. Histopathological examination available for suspicious lesions.',
      '<strong>Scar Treatment:</strong> Comprehensive scar management at Roop Clinique includes treatment for acne scars, surgical scars, traumatic scars, keloids, and hypertrophic scars. Modalities include fractional CO2 laser, microneedling (Dermaroller/Dermapen), subcision, TCA CROSS for ice pick scars, steroid injections for keloids, and silicone gel therapy. Multiple sessions typically required for optimal results.',
      '<strong>Skin Brightening & Pigmentation Treatment:</strong> Treatment for melasma, post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation, sun spots, and uneven skin tone using chemical peels, laser toning (Q-switched laser), topical depigmenting agents, and combination therapies. Personalized treatment protocols based on skin type and pigmentation severity.',

        description: [
          '<strong>Fat Grafting (Lipofilling/Fat Transfer):</strong> Fat grafting is a natural augmentation technique that uses your own fat to add volume to various body areas. At Roop Clinique, we perform fat grafting for <strong>facial rejuvenation</strong> (cheek augmentation, under-eye hollows, lip enhancement, nasolabial fold correction, temple filling), <strong>hand rejuvenation</strong> (restores youthful appearance to aging hands), <strong>breast augmentation</strong> (natural alternative to implants - see breast augmentation page), and <strong>buttock enhancement</strong> (Brazilian Butt Lift - BBL).',
          '<strong>Procedure:</strong> Fat is harvested via liposuction from donor areas (usually abdomen, thighs, or flanks), processed to purify and concentrate fat cells, then carefully injected into target areas. The procedure is performed under local or general anesthesia depending on the extent. <strong>Recovery:</strong> Swelling and bruising for 1-2 weeks. 60-80% of transferred fat typically survives definitively. Touch-up sessions may be needed for optimal results. Fat grafting provides natural-looking, long-lasting results using your own tissue with no risk of allergic reaction.',

        description: [
          '<strong>What is Dimpleplasty?</strong> Dimple creation surgery is a simple, minimally invasive procedure to create natural-looking cheek or chin dimples. Dimples are considered attractive facial features in many cultures, and this procedure allows individuals who weren\'t born with them to achieve this look definitively.',
          '<strong>Procedure at Roop Clinique:</strong> Performed under local anesthesia in about 30 minutes. A small incision is made inside the cheek (no external scars). A small amount of cheek muscle is removed and the inner skin is sutured to create a dimple. Initially, the dimple is visible all the time, but after 2-3 weeks of healing, it becomes dynamic (appears only when smiling). <strong>Recovery:</strong> Minimal - most patients resume normal activities the same day. Mild swelling for a few days. Soft diet recommended for 1-2 days. Results are definitive and natural-looking.',

        description: [
          '<strong>What is Buccal Fat Removal?</strong> Buccal fat pad removal is a facial contouring procedure that removes the buccal fat pads from the cheeks to create a slimmer, more sculpted facial appearance. It\'s ideal for patients with round or "chubby" cheeks who desire more defined cheekbones and a V-shaped facial contour.',
          '<strong>Procedure at Roop Clinique:</strong> Performed under local anesthesia in about 30-45 minutes. Small incisions are made inside the mouth (no external scars). The buccal fat pad is carefully identified and a portion is removed. The amount removed is customized based on desired outcome and facial structure. <strong>Recovery:</strong> Swelling for 1-2 weeks (can take 3-6 months for final results to be visible). Soft diet for a few days. Most patients return to work within 2-3 days. Results are definitive as buccal fat pads do not regenerate. <strong>Important:</strong> Not recommended for patients with already thin faces or those who may lose facial volume with age.',

At Roop Clinique, we offer <strong>split earlobe repair</strong> (complete tear from earring), <strong>stretched/elongated earlobe repair</strong> (from heavy jewelry), <strong>gauge reversal</strong> (closing stretched gauge holes), and <strong>earlobe reduction</strong> (for naturally large or aging earlobes). Procedure takes 30-45 minutes under local anesthesia. Sutures removed in 7-10 days. Re-piercing possible after 6-8 weeks in a slightly different location.',
          '<strong>Other Minor Procedures at Roop Clinique:</strong> <strong>Lipoma removal</strong> (benign fatty tumors under the skin), <strong>Sebaceous cyst removal</strong> (blocked oil gland cysts), <strong>Corn and callus removal</strong> (foot), <strong>Ingrown toenail correction</strong>, <strong>Minor scar revision</strong> (improving appearance of existing scars), <strong>Skin biopsy</strong> (for diagnosis of suspicious lesions), <strong>Gynecomastia surgery</strong> (male breast reduction - see separate page), and <strong>Accessory nipple removal</strong>.

      question: 'How many PRP sessions are needed for hair restoration?',
      answer:
        'For hair restoration, we typically recommend 3-4 PRP sessions spaced 4-6 weeks apart for initial treatment, followed by maintenance sessions every 6-12 months. Results become visible after 3-6 months as new hair growth develops. PRP works best for early to moderate hair thinning and can be combined with other treatments for enhanced results.',

    {
      question: 'Are chemical peels safe for Indian skin?',
      answer:
        'Yes, when performed by trained professionals at Roop Clinique, chemical peels are safe for Indian skin. We carefully select the appropriate peel type and concentration based on your skin type and concerns. Superficial peels are generally safe for all skin types. Medium and deep peels require more caution in darker skin tones to prevent post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation. Pre-treatment preparation and proper aftercare are essential.',
    },
    {
      question: 'How long does tattoo removal take?',
      answer:
        'Complete tattoo removal typically requires 6-12 laser sessions spaced 6-8 weeks apart. The exact number depends on tattoo size, ink colors, ink depth, tattoo age, and your skin type. Black ink responds best to laser treatment. Multi-colored tattoos may require more sessions. Amateur tattoos usually fade faster than professional ones. Patience is key as results are gradual.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Is dimple creation surgery definitive?',
      answer:
        'Yes, dimple creation surgery (dimpleplasty) provides definitive results. The dimple may appear constant initially but becomes dynamic (appearing only when smiling) after 2-3 weeks of healing. The procedure is performed inside the mouth, leaving no visible external scars. Results look natural and last a lifetime.',
    },
    {
      question: 'What is the recovery time for buccal fat removal?',
      answer:
        'Most patients return to work within 2-3 days after buccal fat removal. Swelling peaks at 2-3 days and gradually subsides over 1-2 weeks. However, final results may take 3-6 months to be fully visible as all swelling resolves and the face settles into its new contour. A soft diet is recommended for a few days after surgery.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Can torn earlobes be re-pierced after repair?',
      answer:
        'Yes, earlobes can be re-pierced approximately 6-8 weeks after lobuloplasty (earlobe repair surgery), once the tissue has fully healed. The new piercing should be placed in a slightly different location than the original to avoid the scar tissue. We recommend using lightweight earrings after re-piercing to prevent future tears.',
    },
    {
      question: 'How long do dermal filler results last?',
      answer:
        'Dermal filler results typically last 6-18 months depending on the type of filler used, treatment area, and individual metabolism. Lip fillers generally last 6-9 months, while cheek and jawline fillers can last 12-18 months. Hyaluronic acid fillers are reversible and can be dissolved if needed. Maintenance treatments help sustain results over time.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Is fat grafting better than fillers for facial rejuvenation?',
      answer:
        'Both have their advantages. Fat grafting uses your own tissue (no allergic reaction risk) and provides longer-lasting results (60-80% definitive survival). However, it requires liposuction and more recovery time. Fillers are quicker, have no downtime, and are reversible, but require repeat treatments. Your surgeon at Roop Clinique will recommend the best option based on your goals and preferences.',
