      'At Roop Plastic Surgery Clinique, we offer comprehensive <strong>post-bariatric body contouring</strong> procedures for patients who have achieved significant weight loss through bariatric surgery (gastric bypass, sleeve gastrectomy, lap band) or lifestyle changes. After losing 50-100+ pounds, patients are often left with excess, hanging skin that cannot be eliminated through diet or exercise alone. This excess skin can cause physical discomfort, hygiene issues, skin infections, difficulty with mobility and exercise, and psychological distress. Our expert surgeons specialize in body contouring after massive weight loss, helping patients complete their transformation journey.',
      '<strong>Lower Body Lift (Belt Lipectomy)</strong> is the most comprehensive lower body procedure, addressing the abdomen, flanks, hips, back, and buttocks in a single 360-degree operation. This circumferential procedure removes excess skin and fat around the entire lower torso, tightens abdominal muscles, lifts and reshapes the buttocks, and improves thigh contour. Typical surgery time is 4-6 hours under general anesthesia. Recovery requires 4-6 weeks off work and 6-8 weeks before resuming exercise. Results are dramatic, creating a more proportionate and toned lower body appearance.',
      '<strong>Upper Body Contouring</strong> includes arm lift (brachioplasty) to remove hanging skin from upper arms, creating more toned, defined arm contours with incisions typically along the inner arm from elbow to armpit. <strong>Breast procedures</strong> for post-bariatric patients include breast lift (mastopexy) to lift and reshape sagging breasts, often with implants for volume restoration, and breast reduction for women with excessively large, heavy breasts causing back and neck pain. <strong>Thigh Lift</strong> removes excess skin from inner and outer thighs, improving contour and eliminating chafing. Incisions are placed in the groin crease and may extend down the inner thigh depending on the amount of excess skin.',

      '<strong>Why Staging is Important:</strong> Post-bariatric body contouring is extensive and typically cannot be safely performed in a single operation. Procedures are staged (performed separately, usually 3-6 months apart) to minimize surgical risk, allow adequate healing between procedures, and achieve optimal results. Most patients require 2-4 separate surgical stages to address all areas of concern. Common staging approach includes: <strong>Stage 1 - Lower Body:</strong> Lower body lift or extended abdominoplasty with liposuction (most common first procedure as it addresses the largest area and provides the most dramatic improvement). <strong>Stage 2 - Upper Body:</strong> Breast lift/reduction/augmentation combined with arm lift. <strong>Stage 3 - Thighs:</strong> Inner and/or outer thigh lift. <strong>Stage 4 - Face/Neck:</strong> Facelift and neck lift if needed (massive weight loss can cause facial sagging).',
    features: [
      '<strong>Pre-Operative Requirements:</strong> Patients must maintain stable weight for at least 6-12 months before body contouring surgery. BMI should ideally be under 32 (some surgeons accept up to 35). Complete nutritional optimization with vitamin and protein supplementation is essential. Medical clearance from bariatric surgeon and primary care physician is required. Stop smoking at least 6-8 weeks before surgery (smoking dramatically increases complications). Realistic expectations about scarring - post-bariatric body contouring involves significant incisions and permanent scars, but these are strategically placed to be hidden by clothing and are usually considered an acceptable trade-off for removing excess skin.',
      '<strong>Recovery & Results:</strong> Initial recovery takes 2-3 weeks with significant restrictions on movement and lifting. Drains are typically placed and removed within 1-3 weeks based on output. Compression garments must be worn for 6-8 weeks continuously. Most patients return to desk work within 2-4 weeks but avoid strenuous activity for 6-8 weeks. Swelling peaks at 3-5 days and gradually subsides over 3-6 months. Final results are visible at 12-18 months when all swelling has resolved and scars have matured. Patient satisfaction is typically very high despite significant scarring.',

        title: 'Candidacy & Pre-Operative Optimization',
        description: [
          'Ideal candidates for post-bariatric body contouring have lost significant weight (typically 50-100+ pounds or more), maintained stable weight for 6-12 months minimum, achieved BMI under 32-35, completed or nearly completed their weight loss journey (within 10-15 pounds of goal weight), are in good overall health despite previous obesity, are non-smokers or willing to quit, and have realistic expectations about outcomes and scarring. Medical conditions like diabetes, hypertension, and sleep apnea should be well-controlled.',
          'Pre-operative optimization is critical for post-bariatric patients. This includes comprehensive lab work to assess nutritional status (protein, albumin, iron, B12, vitamin D, folate), correction of any nutritional deficiencies through supplementation (may take 2-3 months), achieving and maintaining stable weight for minimum 6-12 months, optimizing medical conditions and medications, smoking cessation for minimum 6-8 weeks before and after surgery, psychological readiness and realistic expectations, and clearance from bariatric surgeon and primary care physician. Some surgeons may recommend waiting 18-24 months after bariatric surgery before body contouring to ensure weight stability and nutritional optimization.',

        title: 'Risks, Complications & Long-Term Maintenance',
        description: [
          'Post-bariatric body contouring carries higher risks than standard body contouring due to previous obesity, nutritional challenges, and extent of surgery. Potential complications include wound healing problems (most common, especially in smokers), seroma (fluid collection requiring drainage), hematoma (blood collection), infection, skin necrosis (death of skin edges), wide or poor scarring, asymmetry, blood clots (DVT/PE), anesthesia risks, and need for revision surgery. Risk is minimized through proper patient selection, nutritional optimization, smoking cessation, staged procedures, and meticulous surgical technique.',
          'Long-term maintenance includes maintaining stable weight (weight fluctuations can compromise results), continuing vitamin and protein supplementation as recommended by bariatric team, scar care with massage, silicone sheets, and sun protection, wearing compression garments as directed, regular follow-up appointments, and maintaining healthy lifestyle with proper nutrition and exercise. Results are generally permanent if weight remains stable. Most patients report dramatic improvement in quality of life, ability to exercise, clothing fit, hygiene, self-confidence, and completion of their weight loss transformation. The trade-off of scars for removal of excess skin is almost universally considered worthwhile by patients.',

  faqs: [
    {
      question: 'How long after bariatric surgery can I have body contouring?',
      answer:
        'You should wait at least 12-18 months after bariatric surgery and maintain stable weight for minimum 6-12 months. This ensures your weight loss has plateaued, your nutrition is optimized, and your body has adjusted to the new weight. Some surgeons recommend waiting up to 24 months.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Will insurance cover post-bariatric body contouring?',
      answer:
        'Most insurance companies consider body contouring cosmetic and do not cover it. However, some may cover panniculectomy (removal of abdominal pannus/apron) if it causes documented medical problems like chronic infections, rashes, or mobility issues. Check with your insurance provider and obtain pre-authorization if possible.',
    },
    {
      question: 'How many surgeries will I need?',
      answer:
        'Most post-bariatric patients require 2-4 separate staged procedures spaced 3-6 months apart to safely address all areas of concern. The exact number depends on amount and location of excess skin, your health status, and your goals. Your surgeon will develop a comprehensive surgical plan during consultation.',
    },
    {
      question: 'What about the scars from body contouring?',
      answer:
        'Post-bariatric body contouring involves extensive incisions and permanent scars. However, scars are strategically placed to be hidden by underwear and clothing. They are typically red and raised initially, then fade to flat, light lines over 12-24 months. Most patients consider scars an acceptable trade-off for removing excess skin.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Do I need to reach my goal weight before body contouring?',
      answer:
        'Yes, you should be at or very close to your goal weight (within 10-15 pounds) and maintain that stable weight for 6-12 months before body contouring. If you continue to lose significant weight after body contouring, you may develop more excess skin requiring additional surgery. BMI should ideally be under 32.',
