      'At our clinic, we offer comprehensive <strong>rhinoplasty in Roop</strong> from primary rhinoplasty to complex secondary and revision procedures. Rhinoplasty (Greek: Rhino = nose + Plasty = to shape), commonly known as a nose job, is a plastic surgery procedure for correcting the form (shape), restoring the function (breathing), and aesthetically enhancing the nose. Our expert surgeons combine advanced technology with personalized care for safe, visible, and long-lasting results.',
      '<strong>Primary Rhinoplasty in Roop</strong> is surgery for reshaping of nose in a patient who has never undergone nasal surgery. It can be either a cosmetic procedure performed to improve the appearance of the nose, a medically necessary procedure to improve nasal breathing, or a combination of both. This procedure delivers dramatic results for individuals who wish to improve the appearance and function of their nose. <strong>Secondary Rhinoplasty in Roop</strong> is corrective reshaping of a nose which was operated earlier by a different surgeon (a failed primary rhinoplasty). It requires exceptional analytical and surgical skill to restore breathing function and improve less-than-desirable results from previous nose surgery.',
      '<strong>Revision Rhinoplasty in Roop</strong> involves further changes, augmentation or reduction by the same surgeon in a previously operated nose. Sometimes a primary rhinoplasty procedure doesn\'t produce the desired aesthetic or functional result. Structural support of the nose with patient\'s own cartilage is the single most important aspect of revision rhinoplasty. <strong>Septorhinoplasty in Roop</strong> combines nose reshaping with septum straightening, improving both appearance and breathing function in one procedure. This is ideal for patients with crooked, pinched nose, post-traumatic deviation or collapse.',

      '<strong>Congenital Defects:</strong> Secondary cleft lip nose deformity, Binder\'s Syndrome and other birth defects can be corrected through rhinoplasty. <strong>Traumatic Injuries:</strong> Disruption of normal nose structure making the nose asymmetrical due to accidents or injuries. <strong>Cosmetic Concerns:</strong> Hump correction, length correction, decrease in height of nose, dorsal hump removal, and overall facial harmony improvement. <strong>Functional & Structural Issues:</strong> Correction of deviated nasal septum with crooked or off-center dorsum, damaged valves causing breathing difficulties, and nasal airway obstruction.',
    features: [
      '<strong>Nasal Tip Reshaping in Roop</strong> addresses drooping, rotating, boxy, bulbous or bifid nasal tips for a refined, balanced appearance. Excessively flared or pinched nostrils can also be corrected. <strong>Cartilage Grafting in Rhinoplasty</strong> uses patient\'s own cartilage from septum, ear, or rib to produce a successful rhinoplasty outcome with cosmetically pleasing skeletal contour and durable skeletal support to maintain that contour over time.',
      '<strong>Open Rhinoplasty in Roop</strong> provides excellent visibility through a small columellar incision, enabling direct visualization of nasal skeleton for diagnostic accuracy and precise modifications. Most effective for complex cases and revision procedures. <strong>Closed Rhinoplasty in Roop</strong> involves all incisions hidden within the nostril with no external scars, suitable for minor corrections and patients seeking completely hidden incisions.',

        title: 'Treatment Process & Results',
        description: [
          'Every rhinoplasty begins with detailed consultation to understand patient\'s desires and expectations, evaluate the nose, and discuss the procedure, downtime and complications. Pre-operative evaluation by anaesthetist is mandatory. The surgery is performed under general anesthesia and typically takes 1-3 hours depending on complexity. Post-procedure, nasal pack is kept for 48 hours and nasal splint for 2 weeks to support and protect new structures.',
          'Cartilage grafts from septum, ear, or rib are often necessary to achieve cosmetic and functional goals. Minor corrections are done on day care basis, while extensive procedures may require 1-2 days hospitalization. Initial swelling subsides within few weeks, but it may take up to a year for new nasal contour to fully refine. Results are definitive, though aging may have some effect. The surgical goal is to produce a nose that looks natural, functions properly, and is in balance with other facial features.',

        title: 'Post-Operative Care & Recovery',
        description: [
          'Rest and relaxation are strongly advised during first week after surgery. Cold exposure, swimming, strenuous exercise, and face washing are strictly not allowed during initial 2 weeks. No blowing nose or picking for 4 weeks. Patients should not use eyeglasses for 4-6 weeks. Suture removal and plaster change is done on 7th post-op day. Patients with sedentary jobs may return to work after 2 weeks, while those with physical jobs may need 2-3 additional weeks.',
          'Most bruising and swelling resolve within 2-3 weeks. Nasal breathing may be difficult for about 3 weeks due to swelling. Most swelling is gone in first two months. Avoiding exercise or unnecessary exertion is recommended for at least 6 weeks to avoid prolonged swelling and infection. For revision surgery, one must wait at least 6 months to one year as healing and tissue settling takes considerable time.',

      question: 'What is rhinoplasty and when is it done?',
      answer:
        'Rhinoplasty, commonly called a nose job, is a surgical procedure to change the shape or improve the function of the nose. It is performed for congenital defects, traumatic injuries, cosmetic reasons (hump correction, length adjustment), breathing difficulties, or combination of aesthetic and functional concerns.',

    {
      question: 'What is the difference between primary, secondary, and revision rhinoplasty?',
      answer:
        'Primary rhinoplasty is the first nose surgery for a patient. Secondary rhinoplasty is corrective surgery done by a different surgeon to fix a failed primary rhinoplasty. Revision rhinoplasty is further changes by the same surgeon who performed the original operation.',

    {
      question: 'What is the recovery time and when can I see results?',
      answer:
        'Post-surgery, nasal pack stays for 48 hours and splint for 2 weeks. Most swelling subsides in 2-3 weeks, though complete refinement takes up to a year. Patients with desk jobs can return to work after 2 weeks. Physical activity should be avoided for 6 weeks. No eyeglasses for 4-6 weeks.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Is rhinoplasty safe and what are the risks?',
      answer:
        'Rhinoplasty is generally safe when performed by qualified plastic surgeons. Common risks include excessive bleeding, infection, adverse anesthesia reaction, swelling, bruising, and possible need for revision. Patients should select experienced surgeons and ensure surgery is done in well-equipped hospitals with proper facilities.',
